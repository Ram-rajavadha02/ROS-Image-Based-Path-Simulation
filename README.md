# ROS-Image-Based-Path-Simulation
A ROS-based simulation that generates and publishes an image representing a path-finding scenario. Users define obstacles, a start position, and a goal. An arrow moves from start to goal, updating in real-time and stopping if it hits an obstacle. The project demonstrates basic path traversal and visualization in a grid-based ROS environment.
